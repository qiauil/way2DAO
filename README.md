## 为什么会有这个存储库？

最近终于重新联系上了一位了无音信许久的朋友。闲聊之际，他突然问我身边还有没有“初中的那张纸”，他想给她妹妹参考。

>*"从我的切身经验来看，初中好好背那张纸，真的能影响你一生的行为准则和判断标准。"*

他如此说道。

那张纸的确是一张很神奇的纸，陪伴了我们初中整整三年。我们当时的语文老师从一些古文经典中挑选出了很多句子，每句都不长，每天让一位同学讲解其中一句的含义，然后全班一起背诵那一句。每天一句，不多不少，整整三年。

现在已经过去整整十年了，然而我依然对其中的许多句子耳熟能详。我有自信，如果谁无意中提起某个句子的上半部分，我一定能反应出下半句，即使我平常可能想不来那前半句。我也相信，我当年的同窗们大多也一定和我一样。至少，他们应该还记得他们讲的那句。

不必说，当年这些句子对我们的语文水平自然大有裨益，至少在语文成绩方面。然而在高中毕业摆脱了功利性的写作后，这些句子却很少在我笔下出现，他们离我的生活也越来越远。而十年后的今天，当生活逐渐奔向浮尘潇潇，经常灰头土脸的我却经常能不经意间在脑海中涌出那些句子：

> “*知止而后有定，定而后能静，静而后能安，安而后能虑，虑而后能得。*”
>
> *“博学之，审问之，慎思之，明辨之，笃行之。”*

诚然，十年前的我也觉得这些句子十分有意义，读起来也似乎有所得。然而现在的我对这些句子的感悟的确不是那时的我能够达到的。

那张纸我至今还保留着，虽然已经破破烂烂，用胶带反复修补过（当时我们的语文老师戏称之为“读书破万卷”）。但如今我身在重洋之外，没有办法将那纸分享给我的那位朋友。我问了许多朋友，他们短期内也无法找到那张纸。

> "我要是找到了，就上传到github！"

我对那位朋友如此说道。

可何必要等到找到那张纸呢? 

那些句子本身就在那里，在那些古籍中，我自可以将他们找到！

又想起了大学的时候，每天抄一首古诗到笔记本上。我一直觉得那是我大学做过最酷的事情。现在想来，一定也是受了初中那张纸的影响。很开心，现在又可以做另一件很酷的事了。

##  Why Does This Repository Exist?

Recently, I reconnected with a friend I hadn’t heard from in a long time. During our chat, he suddenly asked if I still had "that piece of paper from middle school." He wanted to send a copy to his sister. He said:

>  *"From my own experience, learning those sentences during  middle school really affect my behavioral norms and judgment standards."*

That piece of paper is indeed magical. It accompanied us for three whole years in middle school. Our Chinese teacher at the time selected sentences from ancient Chinese classics. Each day, a classmate explained the meaning of one sentence, and then the whole class recited it together. One sentence a day, no more, no less.

It's been ten years now, but many of those sentences are still familiar to me. If someone mentions the first half of a sentence in that paper, I'm confident I can recall the second half, even if I may not remember the first half during my daily life. I believe most of my old classmates must be the same as me. At least, they should still remember the sentence they explained.

These sentences greatly improved our Chinese proficiency, without a doubt, at least in terms of exam scores. However, after graduating from high school and getting rid of Chinese examinations, these sentences rarely appeared in my writing, drifting farther away from my life. Yet, ten years later, as life becomes less colorful and more challenging for me, these sentences often pour out inadvertently:

> *"Knowing your goals can lead you to pursue them resolutely. Pursuing your goal resolutely builds your inner peace. Inner peace will ease your life. Being at ease in your life can bring you contemplation. Contemplation helps you know more about yourself and the world."*
>
> *“Learn extensively, inquire thoroughly, ponder prudently, distinguish clearly, and practice devotedly.”*

Ten years ago, I did find these sentences meaningful, seemingly gaining something from reading them. However, I feel I have a better understanding of them now.

I still have that paper in my home, though it's in tatters and has been repeatedly repaired with tape (our Chinese teacher once made a joke on that: "I can see that you really study very hard."). But now that I'm overseas, I can not share it with my friend. I have asked many of my old classmates, but none could find it anytime soon.

*"If I find it, I will upload it to GitHub!"* I told my friend.

But why should I wait until I find the paper?

Those sentences themselves exist in those ancient books; I can find them!

I also recall that during college, I would copy an ancient poem into my notebook every day. I always thought that was the coolest thing I did in college. Now, looking back, I must have been influenced by that piece of paper from junior high school. Now, I will start to do another cool thing.
